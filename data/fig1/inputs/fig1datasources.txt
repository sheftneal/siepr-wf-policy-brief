Panel a Burned Area: 

	National
	
	Data source for national burned area 1980s - 2019: https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_stats_totalFires.html
      	Data source for updating to 2020: https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/nfn.htm 
      	historical data suggest about 85% of year-end burned area occurs by 9/15
        
   
	California

	Data source for updating 2019 and 2020: https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2019/  and https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/
        


Panel b Smoke days per year: 
 
	Data source: https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/hms.html
        
	For details on how smoke polygons were aggregated to pop weighted EPA region averages, see Supplement from our NBER paper: 
	https://www.nber.org/papers/w27423?utm_campaign=ntwh&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ntwg25 
        2020 values were calculated through 9/15 and then scaled up according to % of smoke days historically by 9/15 by region
    


Panel c PM2.5: 

	Data source: https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/particulate-matter-pm25-trends
    	
	State level data for 2020 through 9/15 source: https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data
    	2020 state level averages were calculated and merged with EPA regions to match the trends data. 
    	Historically 9/15 PM2.5 averages 95% of year-end totals so 2020 values scaled accordingly
  

Panel d predicted % of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke:
